# Advent of Code Solutions

These are my solutions for the Advent of Code problems.

- 2015: [Rust](/2015-rs) / [ReasonML](/2015-re) \*
- 2016: Nothing yet
- 2017: Nothing yet
- 2018: Nothing yet
- 2019: [JavaScript](/2019)
- 2020: Looking forward to it

\*: I started solving the 2015 problems with native ReasonML in early 2020. When I got back to it in the fall of 2020, I couldn't remember how `esy` or `dune` worked, so I started over in Rust. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
